            <h1>Expanded IAS structure</h1>
            <img src="html ias structure img.png" alt="Image showing an expanded version of IAS structure">
            <ul>
                <li><strong>MBR</strong> = contains a word to be stored in memory or sent to I/O unit or is used to recieve a word from memory/ I/O unit</li>
                <li><strong>MAR</strong> = specifies the address in memory of the word to be written from or read into the MBR</li>
                <li><strong>IR</strong> = contains the 8 bit opcode being executed</li>
                <li><strong>IBR</strong> = temporarily holds the right hand instruction from a word in memory</li>
                <li><strong>PC</strong> = contains the address of the next instruction to be fetched</li>
                <li><strong>AC + MQ</strong> = temporarily holds operands and results of ALU operations</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Three main components of IAS:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Single read write memory</li>
                <li>Contents of this memory are addressable by location</li>
                <li>Execution occurs in sequential fashion (unless explicitily modified) from one instruction to the next</li>
            </ol>

            <h1>Fetch execute cycle</h1>
            <p><strong>Fetch</strong> = opcode of the next instruction is loaded into IR, address portion loaded into MAR, this instruction may be taken from the IBR or memory (by loading a word into the MBR then down to the IBR, IR and MAR)</p>
            <p><strong>Execute</strong> = control cicuitry interprets the opcode and executes the instruction by sending out the appropriate control signals to cause data to be moved or an operations to be performed by ALU</p>

            <p>Connecting various components in a desired configuration</p>
            <p>Programming in software:</p>
            <img src="html programming software img.png" alt="image showing how different programming in software is">
            <p>Instead of requiring the hardware for each new program, the programmer just needs to supply a new set of control signals</p>
