            <h1>Shortest job first scheduling</h1>
            <p>The process with the shortest execution time goes first</p>
            <p>Preemptive or non preemptive</p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h1>Priority first scheduling</h1>
            <p>Priority number associated with each process, SPU allocated to process with highest priority (lowest number)</p>
            <p>Preemptive or non preemptive</p>
            <p>PRoblem with priority scheduling is starvation/indefinite blocking</p>
            <p><strong>Aging</strong> solves this problem by gradually increasing the priority of processes that wait in the system for a long time</p>

            <h1>Round robin scheduling</h1>
            <p>Designed specifically for time sharing systems</p>
            <p>Similar to FCFS but preemption is added, each process gets a small unit of CPU time (time slice) and after this time the process is preempted and either terminates or is added to the end of the FIFO queue</p>

            <h1>Multilevel queue scheduling</h1>
            <p>Ready queue split into separate queues, foreground (interactive) and background (batch) processes</p>
            <p>Processes added permanently to one queue</p>
            <p>Each queue has its own scheduling algorithm</p>

            <h1>Multilevel feedback queue scheduling</h1>
            <p>Process is not permanently assigned to one queue</p>
