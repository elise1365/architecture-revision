            <h1>Architecture and organisation</h1>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Architecture</strong> = attributes that have a direct imapct on the logical execution of a program</li>
                <li><strong>Organisation</strong> = the operational unite=s and their interconnections that realise the architectural operation</li>
            </ul>

            <h1>Computer function</h1>
            <p><strong>Function</strong> is the operation of each individual component as part of the structure</p>
            <p>Computer functions:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Data processing</li>
                <li>Data storage</li>
                <li>Data movement</li>
                <li>Data control</li>
            </ul>

            <h1>Computer structure</h1>
            <p><strong>Structure</strong> is the way the components are interralted</p>
            <p>There are 4 main structural componenets:</p>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>CPU</strong> - controls the operation of the computer and performs data processing functions</li>
                <li><strong>Main memory</strong> - stores data</li>
                <li><strong>I/O</strong> - moves data between the computer and its external environment</li>
                <li><strong>System interconnection</strong> - buses provide communication between the first 3 componenets</li>
            </ol>
            <p>CPU components:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>CU</strong> - controls the operation of the CPU</li>
                <li><strong>ALU</strong> - performs the comuters data processing functions</li>
                <li><strong>Registers</strong> - provides storage internal to the CPU</li>
                <li><strong>CPO interconnections</strong> - provides communications between CU, ALU and registers</li>
            </ul>

            <h1>IAS computer/ stored program concept</h1>
            <img src="html stored program concept img.png" alt="A picture showing how the stored program concept is structured">
            <p><em>Memory of the IAS</em></p>
            <p>1000 storage locations, each called 'words' of 40 bits</p>
            <p>Both data and instructions are stored there</p>
            <p>A word may also contain 2 20 bit instructions with each instruction made up of an 8 bit opcode and a 12 bit address.</p>
            <p><em>Stored program concept</em></p>
            <p>Machine code instructions stored in main memory are fetched and executed serially by a processor that performs arithmetic and logical operations</p>
